# Fake-Page-Django
This site has 4 fake pages that I will add to other pages in the future.
You can run this site on your host and send links to its pages to your friends
After entering the username and password on the fake page, the user will be transferred to the main site and you can see their username and password on the main page after logging in to the admin panel.
